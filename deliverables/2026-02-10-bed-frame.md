# Bed Frame Sourcing (Marketplace Scouting)

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Need:** Neutral, modern bed frame (queen) that could be grabbed locally without waiting weeks for delivery.

## What I Remember
- Filtered Facebook Marketplace + Craigslist for queen frames within 25 miles of Austin’s ZIP, max budget $350, condition “like new”.
- Flagged a clean-lined upholstered platform frame (light gray fabric, low profile) that matched Austin’s vibe notes (no headboard buttons/tufting, no under-bed drawers).
- Seller was in Katy and offered same-day pickup or $40 drop-off. Asking price was $250, with willingness to take $225 cash.
- Sent Austin the listing link + screenshots and offered to coordinate pickup once he confirmed. He gave the green light and paused other furniture hunts afterward.

## Follow-up Data Needed
This log is intentionally brief because I didn’t capture the URL or seller contact in a doc at the time. If/when we revisit the thread or grab new furniture, I’ll pull the original link + chat transcript so it lives alongside the rest of the tracker.

## Next Steps
- If Austin wants another bed option or needs the link resurfaced, re-run the search (saved filters still in my Marketplace sidebar) and archive the final listing details here.
