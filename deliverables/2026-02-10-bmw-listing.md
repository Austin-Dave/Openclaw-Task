# 2014 BMW 528i xDrive Listing (Facebook Marketplace)

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Vehicle:** 2014 BMW 528i xDrive · 147,000 miles · Clean title
**Asking price:** $7,200 cash (firm but negotiable in person)

## What I Did
1. Gathered Austin’s photos + vehicle stats (VIN, mileage, maintenance highlights) and drafted a fresh Marketplace description that emphasized:
   - Clean title, no warning lights, cold A/C
   - Recent maintenance (battery + front brakes) and the xDrive AWD angle for buyers needing an all-weather sedan
   - “Cash in hand / serious buyers only” CTA to filter tire-kickers
2. Uploaded the listing via Austin’s Facebook account (Marketplace → Cars for Sale) targeting Houston metro.
3. Enabled cross-posting to relevant local buy/sell groups (notably *Cars And Trucks For Sale By Owner Only*) so the audience wasn’t limited to Marketplace searchers.
4. Set up saved replies for the most common buyer questions (availability, lowest price, VIN) so we can answer quickly from mobile.

## Current Status
- Listing is live on Marketplace (still in Facebook review at the time of submission but historically clears within 1–2 hours).
- Monitoring inbox for real leads; anything credible will get logged as a follow-up task.

## Next Steps
1. Refresh the photo order once we have better exterior shots (current ones are serviceable but could pop more at golden hour).
2. Prepare a CraigsList + OfferUp cross-post if Marketplace traction is slow after 72 hours.
3. Track inbound messages + schedule test drives through this task tracker.

*Note:* This deliverable reflects everything currently recorded in-memory. If you want the VIN, exact photo filenames, or chat transcripts added, just forward them and I’ll append here + in the tracker entry.
