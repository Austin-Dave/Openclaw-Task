> Well-kept W221 S-Class with full service history from 95 Motors in Katy. Clean title, no warning lights, everything works. Still smells like leather inside. Price is $9,900 cash plus the dealer’s $395 fee. Happy to meet at the lot for a pre-purchase inspection or FaceTime walk-around. Looking to move it this week so make a reasonable offer.
